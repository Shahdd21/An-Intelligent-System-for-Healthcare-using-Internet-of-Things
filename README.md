# An-Intelligent-System-for-Healthcare-using-Internet-of-Things
The proposed system leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate patient monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Biological and environmental sensors send data in real-time to the application, enabling continuous monitoring. The system uses heart rate, temperature, humidity, and gas sensors. These sensors are connected to an ESP8266 board to collect their data and leverage its Wi-Fi capability to send the data over a wireless network to the application. Based on Flutter, the application includes sign-up and login pages for doctors. There is also a rooms page where doctors can select a room and then choose to display a patient's data. The plan for future work includes providing insights based on patients' history for better assessment and implementing push notifications in case of emergencies. In addition to increasing the number of sensors to provide a more comprehensive diagnosis.
