# An-Intelligent-System-for-Healthcare-using-Internet-of-Things
The proposed system leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate patient monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Biological and environmental sensors send data in real-time to the application, enabling continuous monitoring.
The plan for future work includes providing insights based on patients' history for better assessment and implementing push notifications in case of emergencies.
